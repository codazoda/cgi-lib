CGI-LIB is a FREE ANSI C library for CGI programming. It was originally written
by Noel V Aguilar. In February of 2004 Joel Dare found and fixed a small bug. 
After contacting the original author, I decided to fix and distribute this new
version. In October 2014 the license was changed from GPL to MIT to make it
available to more users.

Complete documentation is available in the cgi-lib.html file.
